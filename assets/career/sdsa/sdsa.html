            I develop and maintain stable applications using Java, Python,
            Spring Boot, MariaDB, MySQL, and AWS, collaborating with the
            engineering team to build web applications and APIs. <br />
            In the GenAI Project, I am responsible for maintaining the
            Java-based API Gateway and Copilot systems, as well as developing
            Python tools to analyze their logs for monitoring and
            troubleshooting.

            As a software engineer, I design, develop, and maintain systems
            using Java and Python, handling requirements, testing in AWS
            staging, and deploying to production.
          </p>
          <br />• Resolved ticket number duplication issue ( 3,000 cases/year
          across 8 external applications) by analyzing source code and
          identifying short Redis lock expiration as the root cause; extended
          lock duration to ensure atomicity, resulting in 0 duplication cases
          after the fix.<br />
          • Investigated and resolved performance degradation in API Gateway
          after connector model upgrade by implementing response time logging
          and log analysis; collaborated with connector team to apply a patch,
          improving average response time from 12s to 4s.<br />
          • Resolved critical Linux server storage issue by identifying
          oversized Jenkins build logs ( 40GB per job) and implementing log
          rotation policy, reducing storage utilization from 95% to under
          50%.<br />
