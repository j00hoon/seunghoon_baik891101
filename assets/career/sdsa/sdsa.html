										<h3>Upgrading the monitoring system</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p><strong>Description</strong>
											<br>• Before upgrading, our monitoring system runs every 10 minutes to collect the data.
											<br>• The monitoring system needs to collect the data in real-time.
											<br>• We use Prometheus to collect the data in real-time, and show the data in Grafana as multiple types of graphs.
											<br>• Prometheus, and alertmanager are running on docker server. 
										</p>
										<p><strong>Used Technology</strong>
											<br>• Prometheus, Alertmanager, Jenkins, MySQL, MS VS Code, Python, Eclipse, Linux, Git, Docker

										<h3>Developing batch programs</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p><strong>Description</strong>
											<br>• We have millions of records between customers and employees in US.
											<br>• We have to manage and check these files from all servers (New Jersey and Texas).
											<br>• These files are stored in specific directories in each server. 
											<br>• Get all files from servers and databases, compare and update the check date or delete the records.
											<br>• The key point is the speed of the program, because the records, the servers, and the files are too many.
